Machine Learning Lab Assignment: Feature Engineering/Preprocessing

# Question 1:
Create a vector (array) of 1XN dimension representing N-dimensional feature vector of a sample. Write a program to compute the mean and variance of the elements present in the array. Comment what the mean and variance of sample represents.

# Question 2:
Create two vectors each of dimension 1XM each representing N-dimensional feature vector of a sample. Write a program to compute the Covariance between them. Comment what Covariance between two vectors represents.

# Question 3:
Create two vectors each of dimension 1XN. Write a program to compute the Correlation between them. Comment what the Correlation represents.

# Question 4:
Create a Matrix of MXN dimension representing the M-dimensional feature vector for N number of samples i.e (i,j)th entry of the matrix represents the ith feature of jth sample. Write a program to compute the covariance matrix and correlation matrix. Comment on takeaways from these matrixes.
